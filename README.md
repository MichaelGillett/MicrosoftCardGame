# Microsoft All Stars
A fun, 2 player card game related to, but not affiliated with or endorsed by Microsoft. To be enjoyed with you and your kin.

# Rules

## Aim of the game
To take all the cards off your opponent.

## Setting up the game

* Shuffle the character cards and divide them equally among the 2 players.
* Keep the character decks face down, players shouldn't see their character cards until they play them.

* Shuffle the power-up cards and divide them equally among the 2 players.
* The power-up cards can be viewed by the player.

##Playing the game

* This is a turn based game. Choose a player to start, maybe by asking Cortana to "flip a coin". 
* Both players pick up their top card, not letting the other player see it.
* A player can play a single power-up card per turn to boost the number of tiles on their own card or to reduce the number of tiles on their opponents' card.
* If a player chooses to play a power-up card it must be laid face down in front of the player.
* The starting player then chooses a trait of their top character card in the hope that it is a higher number of tiles than the opponents' top card. Alternatively, they can choose the "Mobile" or "Cloud" option and hope the opponent's character has the same as them or "Neither". 
* If a power-up card is played then its action is now applied. The number of tiles can go to -1 or 5 depending on what power-ups were played. 

###Traits
* If the starting player's chosen trait does have more tiles then they take their opponents' card and place the card they played and the opponents' card to bottom of their deck.
* Any played power-ups are then discarded for the rest of the game.
* It remains the starting player's turn and start their turn again.

* If the opponents' trait had more tiles then the starting player's then the opponent takes the starting player's card; placing both cards on the bottom of their deck.
* Any played power-ups are then discarded for the rest of the game.
* It is now the opponent's turn and start their turn.

* If the number of tiles were equal then each player keeps their cards and places them on the bottom of their decks.
* Any played power-ups are then discarded for the rest of the game.
* It remains the starting player's turn and start their turn again.

###Cloud or Mobile first
* If the starting player's choice is the same as the opponents' then they choose a trait and follow the rules of the traits.
* Any played power-ups are then discarded for the rest of the game.
* It remains the starting player's turn and start their turn again.

* If the opponents' Cloud or Mobile is the opposite then the opponent takes the starting player's card; placing both cards on the bottom of their deck.
* Any played power-ups are then discarded for the rest of the game.
* It is now the opponent's turn and start their turn.

* The "Neither" choice will always lose.
* The "Both" choice will always win, unless both players' characters have "Both". In this case it is a draw and the players keep their characters, placing the card on the bottom of their deck and it remains the starting player's turn and start their turn again.

#Issues
If you find a problem with anything to do with the Microsoft All Stars game have you first tried turning it off and back on? If that doesn't help then please [get in touch](http://twitter.com/michaelgillett) or create your own branch and pull request.

#Community
This game exists because of the community of fans and supporters of Microsoft out there, with many of the current characters being included in the game because people suggested them. 
If you have your own additions to the game, then please use the files in the DIY folder to create your own and then create a pull request.

I've no idea where this might end up, it's just a fun project I've worked on over the past few weeks.

# Credits
Thanks to @MSFTY for the original suggestion and for creating most of the Xbox characters.

This is meant to be a piece of light-hearted fun and I don't mean to cause any offense if any is taken.
