## Setting up the game

* Shuffle the character cards and divide them equally among the 2 players.
* Keep the character decks face down, players shouldn't see their character cards until they play them.

* Shuffle the power-up cards and divide them equally among the 2 players.
* The power-up cards can be viewed by the player.

##Playing the game

* This is a turn based game. Choose a player to start, maybe by asking Cortana to "flip a coin". 
* Both players pick up their top card, not letting the other player see it.
* A player can play a single power-up card per turn to boost the number of tiles on their own card or to reduce the number of tiles on their opponents' card.
* If a player chooses to play a power-up card it must be laid face down in front of the player.
* The starting player then chooses a trait of their top character card in the hope that it is a higher number of tiles than the opponents' top card.
* If a power-up card is played then its action is now applied. The number of tiles can go to -1 or 5 depending on what power-ups were played.

* If the starting player's choosen trait does have more tiles then they take their opponents' card and place the card the played and the opponents' card to bottom of their deck.
* Any played power-ups are then discarded for the rest of the game.
* It remains the starting player's turn, they repeat the first 3 steps.

* If the opponents' trait had more tiles then the starting player's then the opponent takes the starting player's card; placing both cards on the bottom of their deck.
* Any played power-ups are then discarded for the rest of the game.
* It is now the opponent's turn and they now follow the first 3 steps.

* If the number of tiles were equal then each player keeps their cards and places them on the bottom of their decks.
* Any played power-ups are then discarded for the rest of the game.
* It remains the starting player's turn, they repeat the first 3 steps.
